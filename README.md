# Tweet Générateur de Notre-Dame de Paris

## Content
Always wanted to read Victor Hugo, but don't have the time 🤷 ? Want to make your friends think you've read this famous author, even if you haven't?

Why not let a Markov chain digest his work for you and feed you the ideas in tweet-sized bites?

This app uses the tweet generator tutorial for Make School's CS 1.2 course ✏️ to make self-built data structures and provide you with interesting, computer generated sentences worthy of a Tweet 📲 .  

## Deployment
You can find my tweet generator at https://notre-dame-de-paris.herokuapp.com 👩🏾‍💻 . Click on the link and see for yourself!

## Running
If you would like to run this project locally on your own device, after cloning it, enter your virtual environment and enter "flask run" in the root folder in your CLI to see the flask app. It is hosted at http://http://127.0.0.1:5000/. If you would just like to run the Markov chain sentence generator, enter "python3 markov.py".
