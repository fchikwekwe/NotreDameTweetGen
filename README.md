# Tweet Générateur de Notre-Dame de Paris

## Content
Always wanted to read Victor Hugo's the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but don't have the time? Why not let a Markov chain digest it for you and feed you the ideas in tweet-sized bites?

This app uses the tweet generator tutorial for Make School's CS 1.2 course to make self-built data structures and provide you with entertaining, Twitter-worthy tidbits.
